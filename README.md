# Voice Quality Enhancement Tool

## Overview
This project aims to build a **real-time voice quality enhancement tool** to improve voice clarity and intelligibility. The tool leverages Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques and machine learning for features like:

- **Noise Reduction**: Removes background noise to enhance audio quality.
- **Pitch and Tone Correction**: Adjusts the pitch and tone of the voice for natural and clear communication.
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Identifies speech segments for efficient processing.

The project is designed to showcase technical expertise in audio DSP and its applications in speech processing, aligning with the requirements of modern voice assistant systems like Siri.

## Features
1. **Noise Reduction**:
   - Implements spectral subtraction to remove background noise.
   - Optionally integrates a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for advanced noise removal.

2. **Pitch and Tone Analysis**:
   - Extracts and adjusts pitch using DSP techniques.
   - Applies equalization to modify the audio tone.

3. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Captures and processes audio streams in real-time using PyAudio or JUCE.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Displays waveforms and spectrograms for real-time feedback (optional).

## Setup
### Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Python Environment
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install additional libraries if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy librosa pyaudio tensorflow
   ```

### C++ Environment (Optional for Real-Time)
1. Download and set up the JUCE framework: [JUCE](https://juce.com/).
2. Create a new JUCE audio application project.

## Tasks
### Core Features
- [ ] Implement noise reduction using spectral subtraction.
- [ ] Develop pitch and tone adjustment algorithms.
- [ ] Build a lightweight Voice Activity Detection (VAD) module.
- [ ] Integrate real-time audio streaming with PyAudio or JUCE.

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Train and integrate a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for advanced noise reduction.
- [ ] Add a graphical interface for waveform and spectrogram visualization.
- [ ] Optimize the system for low-latency real-time processing.

### Testing and Evaluation
- [ ] Test noise reduction on various audio samples.
- [ ] Evaluate pitch correction and tone enhancement quality.
- [ ] Validate real-time performance and latency.

## How to Run
1. Run the main Python script for offline processing:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. For real-time processing, ensure you have PyAudio installed and execute:
   ```bash
   python src/realtime.py
   ```

3. Processed audio files will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with speech recognition systems.
- Support for multi-language voice processing.
- Deployment as a mobile or desktop application.
